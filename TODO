Backend
** upload files => almost done
** implement your own ckeditor file browser
1. english-content admin interface
4. level 3 limit

5. database schema requirements ( null => false etc )
6. better interface detail
  a. better sorting tree
  b. some english detail should be translated
  c. modify show page
    i some html content should use raw method to represent
** authorization to different department

** news_report and document_files should have a fixed place and it should be render in the page tree
** and also teachers
HOW** : mark delegated as true, content will be the redirect_to path, use its own controller to render, PagesController will redirect those delegated page


Bugs:

Frontend....
whole lot!
1. title bar with department homepage link
2. home page view
** the teacher's view in frontend should be brief intro first which contains phone, email, fields
** and a link to their detailed page


Done:
f:
  * events, news engines
b:
  * if you seach page in page filter, the whole scope will break
